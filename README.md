## Before the Game Starts
You choose one of the six characters, all represented with a color related to their names. 
- Colonel Mustard -> yellow
- Miss Scarlet -> red
- Professor Plum -> purple
- Mr. Green -> green
- Mrs. White -> white 
- Mrs. Peacock -> blue

All the characters are to be present on the board, whether they represent a player or not. They all start at a specific place on the map.

All weapons will be randomly placed on a room. 

There are 21 total cards divided in three groups: suspects with 6 cards, Rooms with 9 cards and Weapons with 6 cards. Each card representing the already mentioned suspects, rooms and weapons. 

In the middle of the map there is be an enveloped with the marking "Case File Confidential”, it is placed at the center of the map. This envelope holds the information about the murderer, the crime scene and the murder weapon. These are randomly selected. 

The cards for the remaining suspects, rooms and weapons are shuffled and distributed as equally as possible (as there are 18 cards left) among all the players. 

You will also be provided with a notebook that has all the characters, all the rooms and all the weapons with some boxes you can cross off when you consider they are *guilty*. It is advisable to cross off one’s cards upon receiving them as, if in your hand, they are not in the envelope. 

**For example:**

Suspects
- [x] Professor Plum
you can cross this because you have this card in you hand and *you know* the envelope cannot contain it.
- [ ] Mr. Green 
you decide not to cross this because you *do not know* if this card is in someone else's hand or in the envelope.


## Game Play
Now the game starts!

Miss Scarlett opens the game, the turns continue clockwise around the board. If no one chose Miss Scarlett, the choice is random. 

On each turn, a player will try to reach a different room of the mansion to investigate. 

To move your character, you need to either roll the die or use a Secret Passage when in a corner room.

If you roll the die, you move however many spaces the die says. Your character can move horizontally or vertically, forward or backward, but never diagonally.

If you move through a Secret Passage, you don't need to roll the dice, you just move to the other room, ending your movement.

You are not allowed to enter the same room twice on the same turn nor pass through a square more than two times in the same turn.

You are not allowed to jump or pass through another character. This includes if the character is blocking an entrance to a room. You also cannot get out of a room if all the entrances are blocked. If this were to happen, you need to wait until someone moves and un-blocks a door.
